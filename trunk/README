This program has been tested on Linux (x86 and x86_64). This shall compile OK on other UNIX-es, however.

It depends on 'libssl >= 1.0.0' and 'libjpeg >= 62'.

To compile run:
1)make
All shall be OK.

After compiling you may run a test:
1)./utility --read out.jpeg "password"
Shall produce some hello world text in less console. The text is hidden in photo with "password" string as secret. In addition, some statistics will appear on stderr.

The smaller your message is, the better it is hidden.

Utility supports three actions:
1)--write - embed message, taken from stdin
2)--read - retrieve message from file, specified
3)--estimate - print jpeg file statistics with available storage space among them.
